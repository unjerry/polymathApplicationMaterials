[Recommendation Letter Start]

Dear Members of the Polymath Selection Committee,

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Zhang Jinrui, 
who is applying for the Polymath Summer Research Program. 
As his instructor in Mathematical Analysis, 
I have had the opportunity to observe his exceptional mathematical 
abilities and his potential for research, and I strongly recommend him for this program.

Zhang Jinrui is one of the most outstanding students in my class, 
demonstrating excellent mathematical reasoning and analytical skills. 
In the Mathematical Analysis course, he actively contribute to discussions in class, 
mastering skilled in using computational modeling 
techniques to address mathematical problems, 
with proficiency in programming languages including C/C++ and Python.. 
More importantly, Zhang has shown creativity and rigor in problem-solving. 
He is able to think independently and offer new perspectives on challenging topics.


I am confident that Zhang Jinrui's academic abilities, problem-solving potential, 
and passion for mathematics make him an ideal candidate for the 
Polymath Summer Research Program. 
I wholeheartedly recommend him and believe he will make a significant 
contribution to the program while gaining valuable academic experience.
