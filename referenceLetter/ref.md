Dear Members of the Polymath Selection Committee,

I am pleased to recommend Zhang Jinrui, a student in my Mathematical Analysis course, for the Polymath program. Jinrui told me about his application for this academic research opportunity. He is enthusiastic about applying mathematical methods in combination with machine learning and analytical techniques. He also mentioned the request for a recommendation letter. He is a hardworking and talented student relative to the other students in my class and actively contributes to discussions in class, so I feel that he would be a qualified candidate for your project.

Jinrui is a critical thinker who frequently asks insightful questions in my class. Moreover, he demonstrates a deeper understanding of the subject matter compared to his peers and often initiates discussions by proposing critical questions. One time after class, he showed me his programming project on high-precision integer arithmetic. By utilizing FFT and NTT algorithms, he achieved an O(N log N) computational complexity for large-number calculations. What surprised me the most was his ability to implement what he learned in class into practical software applications. Although he takes longer to grasp theoretical concepts, he is highly skilled at applying and transforming them into practical solutions.

In addition, he is an effective communicator. He often discusses questions with his classmates after class, and he maintains strong relationships with his peers.

Finally, I think the Polymath program presents a valuable opportunity for Jinrui to expand his horizons and receive essential academic training. He is a patient and focused student with the qualities required for a successful researcher. I am confident that he will achieve success in this field. I highly recommend him for your project.

Sincerely,
Zhou Mingjun
